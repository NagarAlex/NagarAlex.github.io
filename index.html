<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar, an economist who specializes in Economic History.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm from Northern Ireland. I went into university straight out of school, and I've been there ever since,</p>
  <p>although now I have teaching responsibilities, as I am towards the end of my DPhil in Economics at the University of Oxford.</p>

  <h2>My Research</h2>

  <p>My DPhil thesis, titled "Essays in the Economic History of India", consists of three chapters, each a standalone paper. </p>
