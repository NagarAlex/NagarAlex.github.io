<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar. I am an economist by training but really an economic historian these days. 
  I have just completed my DPhil in Economics at the University of Oxford this year.</p>

<p>
  See <a href="./research.html">here for my research.</a> 
 </p>

 <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 <p> These are the keywords (as is customary) that summarize my research interests: Economic History, Institutions, Technical Change, Agriculture, Industrialization (or lack
    thereof) in the "Periphery", Traditional Industries, Monetary History.</p>

<p>My DPhil work has focused on the Indian subcontinent, but I'm also interested in the rest of Asia. </p>
