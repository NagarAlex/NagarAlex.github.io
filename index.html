<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar, an economist who specializes in Economic History.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm from Northern Ireland. I went into university straight out of school, and I've been there ever since,
  although now I have teaching responsibilities, as I am towards the end of my DPhil in Economics.</p>
<p>
  See <a href="./research.html">here for my research.</a> 
 </p>

 <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 <p> These are the keywords (as is customary) that summarize my research interests: Economic History, Institutions, Technical Change, Agriculture, Industrialization (or lack
    thereof) in the "Periphery", Traditional Industries, Monetary History.</p>

<p>My DPhil work has focused on the Indian subcontinent, but I'm also interested in the rest of Asia. I am not convinced by many of the usual explanations as to why growth in Asia (except Japan) was so low until the 1980s. </p>
  
 <p> Monetary history is a subsidiary interest of mine as I originally thought about going into macroeconomics, but got tired with the almost unquestioned view that nominal interest rates are monetary policy. Looking at monetary regimes very different to ours, the gold/silver standards (overrated by their supporters, underrated by their detractors, misunderstood by most) for example, provides a constant reminder of this. </p>
