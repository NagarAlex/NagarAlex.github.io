<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar. I am an economist by training but really an economic historian these days. 
  I have just completed my DPhil in Economics at the University of Oxford this year. I am not "on the job market" in the sense of looking for a tenure track role, but I am looking for postdocs at the moment.</p>

<p>
  See <a href="./research.html"> here for my research.</a> Long ago I decided that my comparative advantage was not in the "X and Y: Evidence from Z" type of (economist-style) economic history, even if that can often be valuable work. Instead, I focus on collecting data from a wide range of sources to get consistent long term time series and use these alongside economic theory to explore the past, much more like a traditional quantitative economic historian. One advantage of that strategy is that I can examine the big picture, and questions, rather than well-identified trivialities. In this sense, I have betrayed my educational background, even if I still think what I do is actually properly still economics.

 <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 <p> These are the keywords (as is customary) that summarize my research interests: Economic History, Institutions, Technical Change, Agriculture, Industrialization (or lack
    thereof) in the "Periphery", Traditional Industries, Monetary History.</p>

<p>My DPhil work has focused on the Indian subcontinent, but I'm also interested in the rest of Asia. </p>
