<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar, an economist who specializes in Economic History.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm from Northern Ireland. I went into university straight out of school, and I've been there ever since,
  although now I have teaching responsibilities, as I am towards the end of my DPhil in Economics.</p>
<p>
  See <a href="./research.html">here for my research.</a> 
 </p>

 <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 <p> These are the keywords that summarize my research interests (as is customary): Economic History, Institutions, Technical Change, Agriculture, Industrialization (or lack
    thereof) in the "Periphery", Traditional Industries, Monetary History.</p>

<p>My DPhil work has focused on the Indian subcontinent, but I'm also interested in the rest of Asia. I am not convinced by the usual explanations as to why growth in Asia (except Japan) was so low until the 1980s. </p>
  
 <p> Monetary history is a subsidiary interest of mine as I originally thought about going into macroeconomics, but got tired with the almost unquestioned view that nominal interest rates are monetary policy. Looking at monetary regimes very different to ours, the gold/silver standards (overrated by their supporters, underrated by their detractors, misunderstood by most) for example, provides a constant reminder of this. </p>
 
 <h2>My Comparative Advantage</h2>
  <p>What is my comparative advantage? I think it is integrating the tools of the economist (economic theory and econometrics) with the attention to detail of the historian. Run regressions all you like, you still have to have a compelling historical story consistent with the broad facts of the case, at the end of the day. Likewise, the historical details do not reveal the underlying fundamental processes unless we apply economic theory to them (and test it). My second thesis chapter, on landlords and tenants in Bengal, is a good example: Most historians have talked about oppressive landlords, and Economists have taken this for granted. A little bit of economic theory and an examination of the data, however, shows that the surprising thing was not the extent of landlord exploitation, but rather that there was so little of it. </p>
