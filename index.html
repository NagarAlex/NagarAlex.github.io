<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar, an economist who specializes in Economic History.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm from Northern Ireland. I went into university straight out of school, and I've been there ever since,
  although now I have teaching responsibilities, as I am towards the end of my DPhil in Economics.</p>

  <h2>My Research</h2>

  <p>My DPhil thesis, titled "Essays in the Economic History of India", consists of three chapters, each a standalone paper.</p>
  <h3> South India and the Great Divergence: Another Look at Francis Buchanan's
Evidence</h3>
  <p>The first is a late contribution to the Indian front of the Great Divergence debate. I show that, contra the revisionist view,
  living standards were low in (South) India around 1800, using the same data source, Francis Buchanan's account of his travels, as they have.
 This begs the question as to why incomes have remained so low for the 200 years since. The other two chapters examine common explanations why. </p>
<h3>Custom to Contract: The Evolution of the Traditional Bengali Land Tenure
System </h3>
  <p> The second chapter looks at agriculture and land tenure. Historians and Economists have frequently blamed the big bad landlords for getting in the way of progress,
    even long after land reform. I here examine the notorious <i>Zamindars</i> of Bengal, and argue that they could not have been the problem over the long run. The reason is because of 
     the widely misunderstood traditional tenancy customs in Bengal. Most tenancies were perpetual leases held on cash rents. Often there were multiple layers of these, a phenomenon known as subinfeudation. 
    Perpetual leases imply less than competitive rents, and otherwise leave landlords with little control over land. I show that the Colonial state enforced these tenancy agreements by examining the legal history.
    I then show that the real burden of rents payable to the superior landlords collapsed in the long run thanks to inflation and the legal security of the tenants' rights. 
    By historical accident, and since colonialism separated landlord wealth from political power, the subordinate right in land became of superior value - the permanent tenant was the real landlord in all but name.
    The <i>Zamindars</i> cannot therefore have been the problem. I instead argue that climate has been the main problem for raising agricultural productivity.
