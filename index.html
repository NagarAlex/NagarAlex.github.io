<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar, an economist who specializes in Economic History.</p>

  <h1>Background</h1>

<p>I'm from Northern Ireland. I went into my Bachelors straight out of school, and I've been in education since,
  although now I have teaching responsibilities, as I am towards the end of my DPhil in Economics at the University of Oxford.</p>
