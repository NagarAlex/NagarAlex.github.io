<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar, an economist who specializes in Economic History.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm from Northern Ireland. I went into university straight out of school, and I've been there ever since,
  although now I have teaching responsibilities, as I am towards the end of my DPhil in Economics.</p>

  <h2>My Research</h2>

  <p>My DPhil thesis, titled "Essays in the Economic History of India", consists of three chapters, each a standalone paper.</p>
  
  <p>The first is a late contribution to the Indian front of the Great Divergence debate. I show that, contra the revisionist view,
  living standards were low in (South) India around 1800, using the same data source, Francis Buchanan's account of his travels, as they have.
 This begs the question as to why incomes have remained so low for the 200 years since. The other two chapters examine common explanations why. </p>

  <p> The second chapter looks at agriculture and land tenure.
