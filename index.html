<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This is the very rudimentary foundation of my website. I am Alex Nagar, an economist who specializes in Economic History.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm from Northern Ireland. I went into university straight out of school, and I've been there ever since,
  although now I have teaching responsibilities, as I am finishing my DPhil in Economics.</p>
<p>
  See <a href="./research.html">here for my research.</a> 
 </p>

 <h2>Research Interests</h2>
 <p> These are the keywords (as is customary) that summarize my research interests: Economic History, Institutions, Technical Change, Agriculture, Industrialization (or lack
    thereof) in the "Periphery", Traditional Industries, Monetary History.</p>

<p>My DPhil work has focused on the Indian subcontinent, but I'm also interested in the rest of Asia. I am not so sure about many of the usual explanations as to why growth in Asia (except Japan) was so low until the 1980s. </p>
