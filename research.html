<p> As of yet I have not got anything published, but this page presents a summary of my research. The focus of my research is to use data and economic theory in novel ways to explore important questions in the Economic History of India - often I find that these conflict with the (usually data-scarce) received wisdom. The first two projects are distilled versions of chapters of my DPhil thesis, and deal with two classic, old fashioned, debates in Indian Economic History. The next two deal with topics of more recent debates among economic historians. The jute versus cotton paper explores one of economic history's greatest mysteries: why did British India not industrialise to a greater extent than it did? The EIC paper is a smaller research project answering a question that I had surprisingly never seen anyone do so before. </p>

Why Was India Able To Beat Britain At Jute But Not Cotton Textile Manufacturing? - Oxford E&amp;SH Working Paper (<a href="https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:6e2b068d-490a-4e13-bb88-8563c883694e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

This paper undertakes a detailed productivity and competitiveness comparison for the cotton and jute textile industries in Britain and India for the period 1860-1940 to examine why India was only able to beat Britain decisively in jute but not cotton. I collect data on factor costs over the period, and examine differences in capital productivity rates. I assess the extent to which manning ratios differed between the two countries for the two industries and whether they changed over time. I then construct implied unit cost ratios, with and without allowing for capital-labour substitution, and use these to infer productivity differences.
As the UK had far higher wages but only marginally lower capital costs for the vast majority of the period, India should have had an absolute cost advantage in both industries, even at British factor proportions, that could only have been increased by capital-labour substitution. This implies some missing (labour) productivity residual in the UK’s favour. I examine an old and hotly debated hypothesis that differences in labour intensity per worker (assuming manning ratios reflected this) explain this productivity gap, while explicitly allowing capital-labour substitution.
Observed differences in manning ratios quantitatively explain the majority of the required productivity gap for cotton, but not jute, throughout the period, and my implied potential increases in profits for Indian firms that reduced manning rates are large and persistent enough to rule out managerial failures (the alternative hypothesis in the literature) as their cause. Such labour intensity differences per worker between the UK and India, relative to the wage ratio, were smaller for jute than for cotton, which explains why India was relatively successful in that industry, and Britain in the other.<br>

 <summary>How Extractive Were Indian Landlords? The Case of Colonial Bengal</summary>
<p>How extractive were Indian landlords before land reform? At least in the case of the
Bengal Zamindars, this paper argues that they were not very good at it. The fundamental
reason is that they gave their land out on cash rent permanent leases. I outline the impli-
cations of this for the distribution of income - the tenant was basically a peasant proprietor
subject to a rent charge - then show that inflation dramatically reduced the rental burden
over the long run. I compile a new dataset on rents per acre between 1790 and 1940, which
shows that these abysmally failed to keep up with inflation: in real terms they were less
than a third in the 20th century of what they had been at the start of the 19th. Colonial
Bengal underwent a gradual, peaceful, market-driven and accidental, land reform.  </p>

<summary>Indian Deindustrialisation Revisited: New Data, Estimates, and Interpretations (Under Review) </summary>
    
<p> I examine the fate of the handicraft spinning and weaving industries in South Asia by constructing new employment estimates.
    Most hand loom weavers survived the introduction of the power loom, and I also construct regional yarn consumption estimates for Bengal, Madras, and the Punjab.
    The living standards of surviving hand loom weavers did not decline. I argue that the introduction of the fly shuttle resulted in an employment decline in the early 20th century - the second "deindustrialisation" - thanks to an inelastic demand for hand loom cloth.</p>

Was Capital Expensive in the Colonial Countryside? The View from the Uttar Pradesh
Land Market
</summary>

<p>
Was capital expensive in Colonial India? This paper addresses this question by examining rents and land prices in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) in Northern India.
I calculate four different estimates of the rate of return to landownership, which by arbitrage should be linked to the rate of return on land-like capital investment more generally.
All show a major decline in interest rates over the 19th century.
By 1870, those used to price landownership were no more than 6 per cent per year.
By 1900, the rent (net of tax) to price ratio was much the same as in England. The rate of return to land was not far from formal sector interest rates: financial markets were integrated. Over the long run there was modest real rent growth, although rents appear to have adjusted slowly to changes in prices.
Land prices skyrocketed, partially due to real rent increases and a declining land tax burden, but also due to falling interest rates. 
These results suggest that capital was not expensive, at the relevant margin for land-like investments, in Colonial India: low investment was due to a low demand for it rather than an expensive supply.

Was Territorial Conquest Profitable? EIC Dividends and Share
Prices, 1660-1874 (Under Review) 
</summary>
<p>
Was the English East India Company (EIC) able to convert territorial control into profits
for shareholders? This paper answers this question by compiling datasets on EIC dividends
and share prices. The results are somewhat suprising. Although there was substantial growth
in nominal aggregate dividends, there was little growth in real terms. Most of which was due
to new stock issues: real dividends per unit of stock were lower after territorial conquest than
during the EIC’s heyday as a trading body. Evidence from the market price of shares, and
from rates of return, supports a similar conclusion. Even at the height of the short lived stock
price boom of the 1760s, the implied, but illusory, increase in shareholder annual income is
a small sum compared to English property incomes. Comparing ex ante rational stock prices
with ex post returns suggest that investors were fairly accurate. The main beneficiaries from
conquest were, therefore, not shareholders but rather the Company’s servants in India. These
results suggest that the joint stock/commercial nature of the Company was largely irrelevant
for developments in India after 1757.

Bengali Agricultural Output Estimates, 1750-1939   
</summary>
<p>
The economic history of Bengal is a statistical black hole. To shine light on it, I estimate agricultural output in Bengal for the Colonial period using the indirect, demand-side, method.
This requires data on nominal wages, nominal prices, and population levels. I bring together data on the first two and extract trends by means of "hedonic" regressions. I construct novel population estimates for the pre-census period by comparing salt consumption figures with contemporary estimates.
Grain wages for agricultural labourers were constant over the long run. Bengal's population approximately tripled over the period, and, as acreage only increased by around 50 per cent, yields doubled. I compare my estimates to the official statistics and find that the latter seriously understated output (by around 35 per cent in the late 1930s) and output growth (by around one per cent per annum after 1890), confirming the suspicions of one strand of the literature. 
That said, while agricultural growth was considerably greater than hitherto thought, it still was not particularly fast and merely kept up with population growth.
