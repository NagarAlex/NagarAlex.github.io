<p> As of yet I have not got anything published, but this page presents a summary of my research. The focus of my research is to use data and economic theory in novel ways to explore important questions in the Economic History of India - often I find that these conflict with the (usually data-scarce) received wisdom. The first two projects are distilled versions of chapters of my DPhil thesis, and deal with two classic, old fashioned, debates in Indian Economic History. The next two deal with topics of more recent debates among economic historians. The jute versus cotton paper explores one of economic history's greatest mysteries: why did British India not industrialise to a greater extent than it did? The EIC paper is a smaller research project answering a question that I had surprisingly never seen anyone do so before. </p>

<h3> How Extractive Were Indian Landlords? The Case of Colonial Bengal </h3>
<p> I examine tenurial institutions in Colonial Bengal, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence for the view that the supposedly exploitative landlords were very bad at being exploitative.
    In short, the landlords (known as <i>Zamindars</i>) gave their land out on permanent leases at high, but crucially nominal, rents early in the colonial era, and inflation dramatically reduced the real value of these rents over the 19th and early 20th century - between 1900 and 1940 such rents averaged only 5 per cent of output or so (while short term subtenants frequently paid around a third of the crop). I prove this with a novel data set of nominal permanent tenancy rents over the period, combined with a paddy (the main crop) price series. Thus there was a gradual, market-driven, peaceful, and accidental land reform in Bengal. Starting out with what was perhaps one of the most unequal distributions of landed property anywhere in the late 18th century, colonial Bengal wound up with normal levels of inequality by the interwar period: there was still a substantial amount of inequality in the distribution of these permanent tenancy rights, as you would expect with a form of property that could be bought and rented (and so the middle classes rather than the landless poor benefitted from them). The superior landlords were prevented from reneging on their contracts with such permanent tenants by a third party enforcer - the colonial state - with the implication that private property rights were largely secure in the countryside.  </p>
<h3>Indian Deindustrialisation Revisited: New Data, Estimates, and Interpretations </h3>
<p> I examine the fate of the handicraft spinning and weaving industries in South Asia by constructing new employment estimates. Most hand loom weavers survived the introduction of the power loom, and I also construct regional yarn consumption estimates for Bengal, Madras, and the Punjab. The living standards of surviving hand loom weavers did not decline. I argue that the introduction of the fly shuttle resulted in an employment decline in the early 20th century - the second "deindustrialisation" - thanks to an inelastic demand for hand loom cloth.</p>

Why Was India Able To Beat Britain In Jute But Not

This paper undertakes a detailed productivity and competitiveness comparison for the cotton
and jute textile industries in Britain and India for the period 1860-1940 to examine why India
was only able to beat Britain decisively in jute but not cotton. I collect data on factor costs
over the period, and examine differences in capital productivity rates. I assess the extent to
which manning ratios differed between the two countries for the two industries and whether
they changed over time. I then construct implied unit cost ratios, with and without allowing
for capital-labour substitution, and use these to infer productivity differences. As the UK had
far higher wages but only marginally lower capital costs, even at British factor proportions,
for the vast majority of the period, India should have had an absolute cost advantage in both
industries that could only have been increased by capital-labour substitution. This implies some
missing productivity residual in the UK’s favour that enabled it to dominate for cotton and hold
out for so long for jute. I examine an old and hotly debated hypothesis that differences in
labour intensity per worker (assuming manning ratios reflected this), ultimately due to worker
preferences, explain this productivity gap, while explicitly allowing capital-labour substitution.
Observed differences in manning ratios quantitatively explain the majority of the productivity
gap for cotton, but not jute, throughout the period, and my implied potential increases in
profits for Indian firms that reduced manning rates are large and persistent enough to rule out
managerial failures (the alternative hypothesis in the literature) as their cause. Such labour
intensity differences per worker between the UK and India (relative to the wage ratio) were
smaller for jute than for cotton, which explains why India was relatively successful in that
industry, and Britain in the other.<br>
    
    <span style="color: red;">Not part of the formal abstract but I want to mention it: This has the interesting implication that while the Indian elite were up in arms about textile imports, the actual workers didn't care enough to put the effort in (for which they would have been paid for) to kick them out!</span>

The Land Market in Colonial Uttar Pradesh: Rents,
Prices, and Rates of Return
</h3>

<p>
 Was capital expensive in Colonial India? This paper addresses this question by examining rents and land prices in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh) in Northern India, using district level average rent and land price data collected by the colonial state for fiscal purposes.
Over the long run there was modest real rent growth, although rents appear to have adjusted
slowly to changes in prices. Land prices skyrocketed, partially due to real rent increases and
a declining land tax burden, but largely due to falling interest rates. I calculate four different
estimates of the rate of return to landownership, which by arbitrage should be linked to the
rate of return on capital investment more generally. All show a major decline in interest
rates over the 19th century. By 1870, those used to price landownership were no more than
5 per cent per year. By 1900, the rent (net of tax) to price ratio was much the same as in
England. These results suggest that capital was not expensive, at the relevant margin for
land-like investments, in Colonial India: low investment was due to a low demand for it
rather than an expensive supply.<br>
    
    <span style="color: red;">Not part of the formal abstract but I want to mention it: High interest rates on consumption loans for poor individuals did not mean that capital was expensive for society as a whole when capital could be rented, or could hire wage labour (the main exception is, of course, human capital). This paper finds this was the case in rural society, and the above paper finds that it was also the case for the modern manufacturing sector. </span>

Was Territorial Conquest Profitable? EIC Dividends and Share

<p>
Was the English East India Company (EIC) able to convert territorial control into profits
for shareholders? This paper answers this question by compiling datasets on EIC dividends
and share prices. The results are somewhat suprising. Although there was substantial growth
in nominal aggregate dividends, there was little growth in real terms. Most of which was due
to new stock issues: real dividends per unit of stock were lower after territorial conquest than
during the EIC’s heyday as a trading body. Evidence from the market price of shares, and
from rates of return, support a similar conclusion. Even at the height of the short lived stock
price boom of the 1760s, the implied, but illusory, increase in shareholder annual income is
a small sum compared to English property incomes. Comparing ex ante rational stock prices
with ex post returns suggest that investors were fairly accurate. The main beneficiaries from
conquest were, therefore, not shareholders but rather the Company’s servants in India. These
results suggest that the joint stock/commercial nature of the Company was largely irrelevant
for developments in India after 1757.
