<h1>Research</h1>

  <p>My DPhil thesis, titled "Essays in the Economic History of India", consists of three chapters, each a standalone paper.</p>
  <h3> South India and the Great Divergence: Another Look at Francis Buchanan's
Evidence</h3>
<p> I take a detailed look at living standards in South India in 1800. </p>
<h3>Custom to Contract: The Evolution of the Traditional Bengali Land Tenure (Shortened version has the title "How Extractive Were Indian Landlords? The Case of Colonial Bengal")
System </h3>
<p> I examine tenurial institutions in Colonial Bengal, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence for the view that the supposedly exploitative landlords were very bad at being exploitative.
    In short, the landlords (known as <i>Zamindars</i>) gave their land out on permanent leases early in the colonial era, and inflation dramatically reduced the real value of these rents over the 19th and early 20th century. The landlords were prevented from reneging on their contracts with such tenants by the third party enforcer - the colonial state.  </p>
<h3>Indian Deindustrialization: Trade or Technology? </h3>
<p> I examine the fate of the handicraft spinning and weaving industries in South Asia by constructing new employment estimates (and much more).</p>
