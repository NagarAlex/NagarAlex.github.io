<h1>Research</h1>

  <p>My DPhil thesis (about to be submitted), titled "Essays in the Economic History of India", consists of three chapters, each a standalone paper.</p>
  <h3> South India and the Great Divergence: Another Look at Francis Buchanan's
Evidence</h3>
  <p>The first is a late contribution to the Indian front of the Great Divergence debate. I show that, contra the revisionist view,
  living standards were low in (South) India around 1800, using the same data source, Francis Buchanan's account of his travels, as they have.
 This begs the question as to why incomes have remained so low for the 200 years since. The other two chapters examine common explanations why. </p>
<h3>Custom to Contract: The Evolution of the Traditional Bengali Land Tenure
System </h3>
  <p> The second chapter looks at agriculture and land tenure. Historians and Economists have frequently blamed the big bad landlords for getting in the way of progress,
    even long after land reform. I examine the notorious <i>Zamindars</i> of Bengal, and argue that they could not have been the problem over the long run. This is because of 
     widely misunderstood traditional tenancy customs in Bengal. Most tenancies were perpetual leases held on cash rents. Often there were multiple layers of these, a phenomenon known as subinfeudation. 
    Perpetual leases imply less than competitive rents, and otherwise leave landlords with little control over land. I show that the Colonial state enforced these tenancy agreements by examining the legal history.
    I then show that the real burden of rents payable to the superior landlords collapsed in the long run thanks to inflation and the legal security of the tenants' rights. 
    By historical accident, and since colonialism separated landlord wealth from political power, the subordinate right in land became of superior value - the permanent tenant was the real landlord in all but name.
    The <i>Zamindars</i> cannot therefore have been the problem. I instead argue that climate has been the main barrier to raising agricultural productivity. 
  </p>
<h3>Indian Deindustrialization: Trade or Technology?' </h3>
  <p>
  The third chapter reassesses Indian "deindustrialization", the decline in  cotton spinning and weaving employment after 1800. Using recent output estimates,
with my own estimates of productivity in hand weaving and spinning, I construct new
employment estimates. Most of the hand loom weavers survived the first "deindustrialization" between 1860 and 1880 caused by (imported) power loom cloth thanks to
product differentiation and local consumer tastes. Employment and output recovered
but the former declined as the latter rose after 1900, thanks to the adoption of the flying
shuttle: the forgotten, second, "deindustrialization" was due to technical change within
small scale industry and was of a comparable magnitude to the first. Hand loom weaver
earnings did not decline. Hand spinning was another story; employment, output and
earnings fell as they had no product niche and the handloom weaver switched to mill
spun cloth. All the while Indian factory output was growing after 1860, eventually overtaking imports around 1920. Since handloom cloth was worth more per square yard,
it held a (slim) majority of market share until the 20th century. I then construct and
calibrate a general equlibrium model to assess whether trade or technology was more
important for "deindustrialization". The counterfactual simulations suggest that technology was overwhelmingly important for employment dynamics, and that trade was
really only important for the factory weaving sector. The Indian factory sector was very
large by international standards - scale was not the problem, productivity was.
