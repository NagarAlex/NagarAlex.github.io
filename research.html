<h1>Research</h1>

  <p>My DPhil thesis, titled "Essays in the Economic History of India", consists of three chapters, each a standalone paper.</p>
  <h3> South India and the Great Divergence: Another Look at Francis Buchanan's
Evidence</h3>
<p> I take a detailed look at living standards in South India in 1800. </p>
<h3>Custom to Contract: The Evolution of the Traditional Bengali Land Tenure System </h3>
<h4> (Shortened version has the title "How Extractive Were Indian Landlords? The Case of Colonial Bengal") </h4>
<p> I examine tenurial institutions in Colonial Bengal, and provide theoretical and empirical evidence for the view that the supposedly exploitative landlords were very bad at being exploitative.
    In short, the landlords (known as <i>Zamindars</i>) gave their land out on permanent leases early in the colonial era, and inflation dramatically reduced the real value of these rents over the 19th and early 20th century. The landlords were prevented from reneging on their contracts with such tenants by the third party enforcer - the colonial state.  </p>
<h3>Indian Deindustrialization: Trade or Technology? </h3>
<p> I examine the fate of the handicraft spinning and weaving industries in South Asia by constructing new employment estimates. Most hand loom weavers survived the introduction of the power loom, and I also construct regional yarn consumption estimates for Bengal, Madras, and the Punjab. The living standards of surviving hand loom weavers did not decline. I argue that the introduction of the fly shuttle resulted in an employment decline in the early 209th century - the second "deindustrialisation" - thanks to an inelastic demand for hand loom cloth.</p>

 <h2>Works in Progress</h2>

    <h3>
Was Territorial Conquest Profitable? EIC Dividends and Share
Prices, 1660-1860
</h3>
<p>
I examine the profitability of the English East India Company from its permanent establishment to its winding up. Perhaps surprisingly, and contrary to widespread opinion, as the company became a territorial power in India, the real value of dividends per share was declining. Rates of return on EIC stock were low. Shareholders were not profiting at the expense of the Indian treasury to any great extent, if at all. These results suggest that
the joint stock/commercial nature of the Company was largely irrelevant for developments
in India after 1757.

 <h3>
Why Was India Able To Beat Britain In Jute But Not
In Cotton Textile Manufacturing?   
</h3>
<p>
This paper undertakes a detailed productivity and competitiveness comparison for
the cotton and jute textile industries in Britain and India for the period 1860-1940 to
examine why India was only able to beat Britain decisively in jute but not cotton.
